# Turn based combat with dynamic mechanics
A prototype of gameplay for an RPG game in which players have to move their team in order to perform more powerful attacks and to evade enemy attacks.

The initial idea is a mix of Chrono Trigger with Undertale in 3D, in which each attack is a minigame which consists in moving characters around the screen to avoid or do damage. This game has some influence of Arkanoid and PONG in how attacks can bounce between characters to do more damage to enemies.

# Current state:
The player can move 4 characters around an enemy.

An attack has been added: A bouncing ball. It disappears after bouncing 3 times or after leaving the area.

Turn system: After using "bouncing ball", the enemy will attack the player with that same attack (the enemy still does not aim his attack)
