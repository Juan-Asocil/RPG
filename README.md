# Turn based combat with dynamic mechanics
A prototype of gameplay for a RPG game in which players have to move their team in order to perform more powerful attacks and to evade enemy attacks.

The initial idea is a mix of Chronotrigger with Undertale in 3D, in which each attack is a minigame which consists in moving characters around the screen to avoid or do damage. This game has some influence of Arkanoid and PONG in how attacks can bounce between characters to do more damage to enemies.

# Current state:

A movement system has been added in which the player can move a group of cubes around an enemy.

An attack has been added: A bouncing ball. It disappears after bouncing 3 times or after leaving the area.

- A turn system
